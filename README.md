# ðŸŒ• Lunar Lander ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Lunar Lander** project! This repository contains the implementation of a lunar landing simulation using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques.

## About the Project

The Lunar Lander project simulates the classic task of landing a spacecraft on the moon. The goal is to safely land the lunar module on the moon's surface using various algorithms and models.

## Features

- ðŸ§  **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes deep reinforcement learning to control the lunar lander.
- ðŸŽ® **Simulation Environment**: Built with OpenAI Gym for a realistic simulation.
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing the landing process and model performance.
- ðŸ§ª **Testing**: Comprehensive tests to ensure the robustness of the model.
